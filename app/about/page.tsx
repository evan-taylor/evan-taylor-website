          <p>
            Hi, I&apos;m Evan. I&apos;ve been passionate about computers and
            programming since elementary school. My journey has taken me from
            teaching myself how to code in 6th grade to founding Taylored
            Instruction LLC, where I combine my technical skills with leadership
            and industry experience.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I started programming in 6th grade and have been fascinated by the
            intersection of technology and human experience ever since.
            Currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with
            a focus on entrepreneurship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond academics, I&apos;m an entrepreneur and leader. As a former
            varsity swim team captain and founder of a Red Cross Training Site,
            I&apos;ve learned the importance of combining technical skills with
            strong communication and leadership abilities.

          <h2>Current Focus</h2>
          <p>
            I&apos;m currently developing skills in machine learning, web
            development, and cybersecurity. My coursework includes algorithms,
            data structures, and systems programming, while my personal projects
            explore full-stack development and data analysis. I am also learning
            about entrepreneurship, and I am currently working on a project to
            help students get things done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through Taylored Instruction, I&apos;m learning valuable lessons
            about running a business, managing operations, and building
            relationships with clients and partners.
